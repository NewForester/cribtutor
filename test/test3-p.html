<h1> Basic test of the HTML parser - Inline elements and Line break </h1>

<p>Text
    in a
paragraph is
    collected together
into a sentence.
</p>

<p>Runs of     spaces    are squeezed out.</p>

<p>    There should be no leading or trailing spaces.   </p>

<p>The presence of <em>mark up</em> in paragraphs should not mess up the appearance.</p>

<p>Even <i>mark up</i> not handled by the program.</p>

<p>No ...<em>mark up</em>... should add white space that is not there.</p>

<p>
A more tricky example. <i><em>Hello</em> Paul</i> !
</p>

<p>Beware a source line break after <i><em>mark up</em></i>
at the end of a line.</p>

<p>
The break ...<br>... should force a new line.
</p>

<p>
As I said break ...<br />... should force a new line.
</p>

<p>
Two force the output ...<br><br />
... of an empty line.
</p>
