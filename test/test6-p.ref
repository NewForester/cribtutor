Display Text for Links and Images

So here is a link with text: "The Wikipedia".

Here is the same link with no text: "".

Display Alternative Text for Images

Here is an image: "W3Schools.com".

Here it is again: "W3Schools.com".

Another for luck: "W3Schools.com".

Here is a link with an image instead of text: "HTML tutorial".

Here it is again: "HTML tutorial".

For Markdown image syntax, pandoc generates <embed> instead of <a>

Here is an inline link: Inline

Here is a reference link: Reference

Here is an inline image: Inline

Here is a reference image: Reference

And the end

Done
