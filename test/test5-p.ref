Ordered lists have similar problems to Code blocks.

There may be text before: 

1 < (less than)
2 > (greater than)
3 & (ampersand)
4 ' (apostrophe) and
5 " (quotes).

and text after.

Again with only text before.

Again with only text after.

  > (greater than)
  & (ampersand)
  ' (apostrophe) and ...
  " (quotes).

There may be text after.

Again with no extra text.

  < (less than).

  > (greater than).

  Twas brillig, - and the slithy toves
  Did gyre      - and gimble in the wabe:
  All mimsy     - were the borogoves,
  And the       - mome raths outgrabe.

  Beware              - the Jabberwock, my son!
  The jaws that bite, - the claws that catch!
  Beware the          - Jubjub bird, and shun
  The frumious Bandersnatch!

  He took his vorpal    - sword in hand:
  Long time the manxome - foe he sought --
  So rested he by       - the Tumtum tree,
  And stood awhile in thought.

  And, as in uffish thought he stood,
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of      - flame,
  Came whiffling through the tulgey - wood,
                                    - And burbled as it came!

Done
