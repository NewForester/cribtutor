Basic test of the HTML parser - Inline elements and Line break

Text in a paragraph is collected together into a sentence.

Runs of spaces are squeezed out.

There should be no leading or trailing spaces.

The presence of mark up in paragraphs should not mess up the appearance.

Even mark up not handled by the program.

No ...mark up... should add white space that is not there.

A more tricky example. Hello Paul !

Beware a source line break after mark up at the end of a line.

The break ...
... should force a new line.

As I said break ...
... should force a new line.

Two force the output ...

... of an empty line.
