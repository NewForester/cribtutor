<h1> For a description of the command line options in simple English just hit return </h1>

<p>
In principle, `-d &lt;dir&gt;`; is the only option needed to run a quiz.
</p>

<p>
The cribtutor program generates a quiz based on the contents of a list of crib-sheets.
</p>

<p>
By default, the crib-sheets are listed in a file named &quot;cribsheets.txt&quot;.
Use `-f &lt;file&gt;` to specify an alternative.
</p>

<p>
Typically, &quot;cribsheets.txt&quot; and the the crib-sheets it lists will be in the same directory.
Use `-d &lt;dir&gt;` to specify this directory.
Typically, the directory names the quiz.
</p>

<p>
If `-d &lt;dir&gt;` does not specify an absolute pathname then
`dir` is relative to the directory that contains the program (which may not be `pwd`).
</p>

<p>
By default, a quiz starts with the first crib-sheet listed in &quot;cribsheets.txt&quot;
but the quiz can be started with any crib-sheet using the `-s` option
to specify the crib-sheet by name.
</p>

<p>
Only the first few characters of the crib-sheet name are needed.
For larger quizzes split into &apos;chapters&apos; and &apos;sections&apos;,
the crib-sheet name typically begins with
the &apos;chapter&apos;/&apos;section&apos; number so:
<pre>
    -s 2        // begin with chapter 2
    -s 23       // begin with section 3 of chapter 2
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Statements in crib-sheets (usually) contain terms the program blanks out when posing a question.
By default, the program will blank out two terms in each statement.
Use `-c &lt;n&gt;` to blank out a different number of terms.
</p>

<p>
Note: To read crib-sheets without questions and answers, use `-c 0`
</p>

<p>
Use `-h` to enter this tutorial but then you already knew that.
</p>

<p>
Use `-t` to use test mode.
Test mode runs short quizzes found in the test directory.
</p>

<p>
Use `-p` to just parse and print a crib-sheet and exit.
No questions and answers, no prompts.
Used to test/debug crib-sheets.
</p>

<p>
Use `-p -r` to just parse and print the parse tree and exit.
Used to debug the crib-sheet parser.
</p>
