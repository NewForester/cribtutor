<p>
In principle, &apos;-d &lt;dir&gt;&apos; is the only option needed to run a quiz.
</p>

<p>
The cribtutor program generates a quiz based on the contents of a list of crib sheets.
</p>

<p>
By default, the crib sheets are listed in a file named &apos;cribsheet.txt&apos;.
Use &apos;-f &lt;file&gt;&apos; to specify an alternative.
</p>

<p>
Typically, all the crib sheets (and &apos;cribsheet.txt&apos;) for a quiz will be found in the same directory.
Use &apos;-d &lt;dir&gt;&apos; to specify this directory.
Typically, the directory names the quiz.
</p>

<p>
If &apos;-d &lt;dir&gt;&apos; does not specify an absolute pathname then
&apos;dir&apos; is relative to the directory that contains the program (which may not be &apos;pwd&apos;).
</p>

<p>
By default, a quiz starts with the first crib sheet listed in &apos;cribsheet.txt&apos;
but the quiz can be started with any crib sheet using the &apos;-s&apos; option
to specify the crib sheet by name.
</p>

<p>
Only the first few characters of the crib sheet name are needed.
For larger quizzes split into &apos;chapters&apos; and &apos;sections&apos;,
the crib sheet name typically begins with
the &apos;chapter&apos;/&apos;section&apos; number so:
<pre>
    -s 2        // begin with chapter 2
    -s 23       // begin with section 3 of chapter 2
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Statements in crib sheets (usually) contain terms the program blanks out when posing a question.
By default, the proram will blank out two terms in each statement.
Use &apos;-c &lt;n&gt;&apos; to blank out a different number of terms.
</p>

<p>
Note: To read crib sheets without questions and answers, use &apos;-c 0&apos;
</p>
