<h1> For a description of how to drive the program hit return </h1>

<p>
Welcome to the Crib Tutor !
</p>

<p>
The Crib Tutor is a simple program.
It walks and talks:  do not expect it to sing and dance.
</p>



<h2> Simple Questions and Answers </h2>

<p>
The program presents assertions (hopefully true and accurate statements) one by one.
</p>

<p>
Each assertion may have one or more terms blanked out.
You will be prompted to fill in the blanks.
Do so and press return.
E.g.
<pre>
    Roses and ___, violets are ___.
    Fill in the blanks:
</pre>
to which you might respond:
<pre>
    red blue
</pre>
</p><p>
If your response is correct, the program will move on to the next assertion
otherwise you will be given a chance to try again:
<pre>
    Oops ... try again [yNq?]
</pre>
</p><p>
The single letter response is expected.
</p><p>
<ol>
<li>
Enter &apos;y&apos; to try again.
You can just try again without entering &apos;y&apos;.
</li>
<li>
Enter &apos;n&apos; to move on to the next assertion.
You can just press enter to move on.
</li>
<li>
Enter &apos;q&apos; to quit.
The program will exit.
</li>
<li>
Enter &apos;?&apos; to see the answer.
The program prints a correct response and moves on to the next question.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
At the end of each chapter/section you may be given the opportunity to do
the whole chapter/section again.
</p>



<h2> Navigation </h2>

<p>
A small crib sheet may not be divided into chapters/sections
but larger crib sheets almost certainly will.
</p>

<p>
When a crib sheet is so divided,
you will be given the opportunity to skip and repeat chapters/sections.
<pre>
    Another Section
    Skip [yNq] ?

    ... lots of questions ...

    Another Section
    Repeat [yNq] ?
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Skip chapters/sections you have done before and do not want to do again.
You can &apos;fast forward&apos; to start at a specific chapter/section using
the command line option &apos;--skipto&apos;.
</p>

<p>
You may want to repeat a chapter/section
when you have answered some questions incorrectly.
Be aware the terms blanked may be different from last time.
</p>

<p>
Each assertion has a number of terms
but the program only blanks so many chosen at random.
By default, it will blank at most two terms in each assertion
but you can change this using the command line option &apos;--choices&apos;.
</p>

<p>
You may want to repeat a chapter/section
even when you have answered all questions correctly.
Why ?
Because the number of &apos;choices&apos; is upped by one
and so some questions will have more blanked terms.
</p>

<p>
If you answered all questions correctly
and upping the &apos;choices&apos; will make no difference to the questions
you won&apos;t be asked if you want to repeat the chapter/section.
</p>

<p>
An assertion with no blanked terms is simply printed, no questions asked.
As the number of choices goes up, assertions with few terms are also simply printed
and only those with many blanked terms are quizzed.
</p>

<p>
You can just read a crib sheet without questions by invoking the program
with &apos;--choices 0&apos;
</p>

<p>
Remember you can quit at any time and restart later using &apos;--skipto&apos;
to resume the chapter where you left off
and then responding &apos;y&apos; to skip sections you don't want to do again.
</p>



<h2> Compound and Hyphenated Terms </h2>

<p>
Many terms are single words, but some, such as &apos;black hole&apos;
or &apos;point singularity&apos;, are not.
In a crib sheet, a term like black hole might be written
as two simple, one word, terms that can be blanked independently
or as one compound term where both words are either blanked or not.
</p>

<p>
A well thought out crib sheet will be consistent:
it will not use a compound term in one place and two simple terms in another.
The program cannot correct inconsistency of this nature
any more than it can correct bad spelling.
</p>

<p>
For compound terms, the program uses a sequence of blanks so that you know
how many words are expected.
In terms of choices, a compound term is one choice
so more blanks may appear than you might expect.
</p>

<p>
Names comprising more than one word,
such as World Health Organisation, are compound terms.
For these, capitalisation is expected,
even when the name appears at the start of a sentence.
</p>

<p>
A hyphenated term (such as 'read-only') is like a compound term
only '-' (the minus sign) is used to separate words instead of a space.
The program indicates hyphenated terms by printing a '-' between the words
instead of a space.
When you enter your response, you may enter either '-' or space between the words.
</p>

<p>
The program does not treat &apos;microcomputer&apos;, &apos;micro computer&apos;
and &apos;micro-computer&apos; as alternatives.
A well thought out crib sheet will pick one spelling and use it consistently.
</p>



<h2> Unordered Lists and Paired Terms </h2>

<p>
Some questions will be constructed from unordered lists.  For example:
<pre>
    The four cardinal points are: north, ____, east and ____.
    Fill in the blanks:
</pre>
</p>

<p>
In this case, you would expect the answer to be:
<pre>
    south; west
</pre>
but it could be:
<pre>
    west; south
</pre>
That would be annoying.
</p>

<p>
A well thought out crib sheet will not be deliberately irritating in this fashion
but remembering the exact order of 7 or 8 terms in a list is difficult
and usually misses the point:
remembering the terms is important, not their order.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the program allows blanks from unordered lists to be filled in in any order.
Hopefully you won&apos;t even notice.
</p>

<p>
Questions may contain terms paired by the conjunctions 'and' or 'or':
<pre>
    The two poles of a magnet are ____ and ____.
    Fill in the blanks:
</pre>
The program will allow you to fill in the blanks either way
("negative, positive" or "positive, negative").
Just don't enter the 'and' (or the 'or').
</p>

<p>
Questions may contain pairs of terms separated by a slash ('/')
instead of a conjunction:
<pre>
    A closed question requires a ____/____ response.
    Fill in the blanks:
</pre>
The program will allow you to fill in the blanks in either way
(so "yes/no" or "no/yes").
You may enter the '/' or just a space between the words.
</p>



<h2> Typographical Leeway </h2>

<p>
The program will generally consider
a response containing a typo to be an incorrect response,
which can be frustrating.
</p>

<p>
There are number of ways in which the program tries to reduce this frustration.
</p>

<p>
It will accept alternative spellings in certain simple and common cases.
E.g. &apos;-ize&apos; for &apos;-ise&apos; and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
It will accept the plural instead of singular and vice versa for common cases.
E.g. &apos;axes&apos; for &apos;axis&apos; (and &apos;ax&apos;).
However, a well thought out crib sheet will phrase assertions so that it is clear
whether a singular or plural noun is required.
</p>

<p>
For simple terms blanked at the start of a sentence,
the program will accept a response with or without the initial letter capitalised.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the program shows correct responses
with terms terminated by comma or semi-colon.
The comma indicates terms from an unordered list
and no punctuation separates the words in a compound term.
You can enter response with or without punctuation characters:
the program simply ignores a semi-colon, comma (or full stop) at the of a word.
</p>



<h2> Tips and Tricks </h2>

<p>
You will find these features by accident but just for the record ...
</p>

<p>
No response (just press return) to the
<pre>
    Fill in the blanks:
</pre>
prompt moves on to the next question (or the end of chapter/section).
This effectively skips this question as no response
does not count as an incorrect answer.
</p>

<p>
In response to the
<pre>
    Fill in the blanks:
</pre>
prompt, a single letter response of &apos;q&apos; or &apos;?&apos;
is taken to be the response to the next prompt:
<pre>
    Oops ... try again [yNq?]
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Any response of more than a single character to the
<pre>
    Oops ... try again [yNq?]
</pre>
prompt is taken to be an implicit &apos;y&apos; and is checked without issuing the
<pre>
    Fill in the blanks:
</pre>
prompt.
</p>

<p>
Finally, just a little hint:
<pre>
    ./cribtutor dir skip_to choices cribsheet_name
</pre>
is, effectively, the same as:
<pre>
    ./cribtutor -d dir -s skip_to -c choices -f cribsheet_name
</pre>
</p>
