<h1> For a description of the basic ideas hit return </h1>

<p>
I admire the koans approach to learning a programming language
but I wanted something that might work for any (technical) subject,
not just programming languages with unit test frameworks.
</p>

<p>
The inspiration for this program comes from a singular experience
at school of learning Jabberwocky by Lewis Carol.
</p>

<p>
In one 40 minute period a mixed class of teenage boys
(mixed in terms of ability, motivation and attention spans) learnt to recite
this famous nonsense rhyme from memory.
</p>

<p>
The teacher presented the poem on a slide
(this was in the days when overhead projectors were still cool)
and the class read it out loud.
</p>

<p>
The next slide had a word missing from each verse.
We were asked to read it out loud, filling the missing words from memory.
That was easy.
</p>

<p>
The next slide had two words missing from each verse.
This cycle repeated until all the words were missing.
The class simply recited the whole poem from memory.
</p>

<p>
I was astonished because it hadn&apos;t actually involved much effort
(although I rather suspect the teacher had been up all night preparing the slides).
</p>

<p>
It was effective in that for years afterwards I was able to recite this poem
(whereas I struggled to remember overnight simple mnemonics like HHeLiBeBCaNOFNe).
</p>

<p>
It was also fun, a lot more fun than any other deliberate attempt I have ever made to
memorise something.
</p>

<p>
I think our teacher&apos;s interest was how the technique would work with a nonsense
rhyme where made up words were a substantial part of each verse.
</p>

<p />

<p>
Recently I needed to get up to speed on a subject that I remember being exposed to years ago
that everyone assumes you know backwards these days.

The subject was technical so although the words were not made up, their meanings were.

I knew I could master it but the learning curve looked steep: it was almost as if I was reading nonsense prose.
</p>

<p>
That was when I decided to write a program to automate what the teacher had done by hand all those years ago.
</p>

<p>
The first idea was to use the `--choices` flag to progressively blank out more and more terms and in doing so
learn (as in remember, not necessarily understand) the contents of a crib-sheet.
</p>

<p>
At the outset I recognised that being able to recall individual facts from a crib-sheet is
rather different from being able to recite a poem from start to finish.

I have known people with dyslexia considerably worse than my own who can recite the alphabet
but who can&apos;t tell you which letter comes after &apos;p&apos; without actually reciting (in their heads) from &apos;a&apos; all the way to &apos;q&apos;.
</p>

<p>
I needed my program to support &apos;random&apos;, not &apos;sequential&apos;, memory recall.

Hence the program&apos;s random blanking of terms and its support for shuffling paragraphs and lists.

This is not a feeble attempt to make things fiendish difficult but an attempt to avoid learning by rote.
</p>

<p>
Despite having used a keyboard now for so many years that I can&apos;t write with my hands any more,
my typing is still inaccurate.

I find filling in the blanks correctly difficult enough without having to worry about transatlantic spelling differences.
</p>

<p>
So the third priority for the program was trying to lessen the frustration of knowing you know the answer
but having the dumb program reject your answer because of something as trivial as entering &apos;criticise&apos; instead of &apos;criticize&apos;.
</p>

<p>
Sadly the program does not use a spell checker:
my fourth objective was to keep the program simple.
</p>

<p>
The user interface is a command line interface and so may appear terribly old fashioned to those who grew up with GUIs.

No matter: the program is pedagogic and writing it was an auto didactic exercise.
</p>

<p />

<p>
I have a feeling that I will never really &apos;grok&apos; these &apos;intuitive&apos; GUI web interfaces until I&apos;ve built a GUI web application myself.
To do that I need to master a whole gamut of technical subjects.
I learn best when I have a real goal in mind.
When I have, if you will, a practical application for my learning.
</p>

<p>
This program is just a place to start.

This is, and always was, the basic idea.
