<h1> For notes on how to write crib sheets hit return </h1>

<p>
So you want to write your own crib sheets ?
It is an even more effective way of learning the essentials of a subject
but it is not quick and creating good crib sheets is not automatic.
</p>

<p>
The crib sheets used by the cribtutor program contain html markup.
The program is not a web application (although someday it might be)
although it should be able to parse any html document.
</p>

<p>
However, the program cannot turn an arbitrary web page into a quiz:
it recognises a limited number of html elements and processes some of them in ways
specific to the program.
Thus crib sheets are best crafted specially for the program.
</p>
<p>
Questions should be constructed to reinforce what is being learnt.
A good quiz has a lot to do with containing questions that are not too easy but not too hard
and a really good quiz is not tedious but fun.
</p>
<p>
It is important to avoid inconsistency and ambiguity lest the quiz become a frustrating guessing game.
</p>



<h2> Html Markup </h2>

<p>
The user interface is simple:
html markup other than that described below,
such as bold and italic,
may be present in a crib sheet but the program ignores it.
</p>

<h3> Html Elements Recognised by the Program </h3>
<p>
Terms that can be blanked are enclosed in &lt;em&gt; ... &lt;/em&gt;.
Most terms are single words.
Those that comprise more than one word are called &apos;compound terms&apos; or &apos;hyphenated terms&apos;
and are handled slightly differently.
</p><p>
Quiz questions are formed by blanking terms from sentences enclosed in &lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt;.
An html paragraph containing no terms is simply printed
but otherwise each paragraph is a separate question.
</p><p>
Within paragraphs, the program recognises code blocks (&lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;)
and both ordered (&lt;ol&gt; ... &lt;/ol&gt;) and unordered (&lt;ul&gt; ... &lt;/ul&gt;) lists.
Lists have special interpretation and should not be nested.
Code blocks are not expected to contain terms but lists are.
Terms should be nested within list items (&lt;li&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt;) and not the other way around.
</p><p>
The program recognises &lt;br&gt;.
Two successive &lt;br&gt; will produce a blank line within a question.
Contrast with an empty paragraph (e.g. &lt;p /&gt;),
which will produce a blank line between questions.
</p><p>
Outside paragraphs, the program recognises three levels of header: &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt;.
These are used to structure a quiz into &apos;chapters&apos; and &apos;sections&apos;.
The program recognises, but ignores &lt;hr&gt;.
</p><p>
The program recognises html comments (&lt;!-- ... --&gt;) anywhere.
They may be used (temporarily) to comment out other html elements.
Comments are used to direct the behaviour of the program in two particular circumstances.
Comments are not output by the program.
</p><p>
The program recognises and converts html escape sequences.
Note &apos;&amp;lt;&apos; and &apos;&amp;gt;&apos; must be used for &apos;&lt;&apos; and &apos;&gt;&apos;.
The program ignores element attributes
(in particular those that affect the &apos;numbering&apos; of lists).
</p>


<h3> The Blanking of Terms </h3>
<p>
A question with a larger number of terms blanked is, a priori,
more difficult to answer correctly than a question with fewer terms blanked.
</p><p>
The user has some control over the level of difficultly through the &apos;--choices&apos; flag.
This sets the maximum number of terms that may be blanked in each question.
The default is two.
Through the choice of terms, the quiz setter / author of the crib sheet
also has some control over the level of difficultly of each question.
</p><p>
When there are more terms than choices,
the program selects which terms to blank randomly.
This means a different selection of terms will be blanked when a section is repeated.
Furthermore, if the user chooses to repeat after answering all questions correctly
then the number of choices will be one greater.
</p><p>
These measures are designed to make the quiz less predicable (and perhaps more fun).
</p>


<h3> Compound and Hyphentated Terms </h3>
<p>
When a simple term is blanked, it is printed as &quot;____&quot;.
There is no indication as to the length of the term.
</p><p>
When a compound term is blanked, it is printed as a sequence of &quot;____&quot;
separated by spaces to indicate how many words there are in the term.
When a hyphenated term is blanked, it is printed as a sequence of &quot;____&quot;
separated by &apos;-&apos; to indicate where the terms is split into words.
</p><p>
This means the number of &quot;____&quot; may be greater than the number of choices
(that&apos;s a hint to the user).
It also means a sequence of simple terms
is difficult to distinguish from a compound term.
Avoid such sequences:
consider using a compound term, a hyphenated term, punctuation characters or an unordered list.
</p>


<h3> Unordered and Ordered Lists </h3>
<p>
The way the program treats ordered and unordered lists is different from that of an html viewer.
In particular, it makes no attempt to &apos;number&apos; or &apos;bullet&apos; lists.
</p><p>
Unordered lists present a problem (that is more acute the longer the list):
what is important is the terms in the list, not their order.
The user is allowed to enter terms blanked from unordered lists in any order.
</p><p>
The program presents an unordered list as simply a sequence of words.
The implication is that an unordered list is, essentially, a list of terms.
It is recommend you use punctuation (such as the comma) between list items to avoid this appearing as a long compound term.
</p><p>
If you need a list where terms and ordinary text are mixed, then use an ordered list.
The user will have to enter terms in question order.
</p><p>
The program presents each list item on a separate line.
When a list item ends with a full stop, a blank line will separate it from the next list item.
</p><p>
The program does not provide numbering of items (but you can provide this yourself).
List items can be shuffled (but this is hardly compatible with numbering).
</p>


<h3> Paired Terms </h3>
<p>
The programs considers adjacent terms separated by a conjunction
(&quot; and &quot;, &quot; or &quot;, &quot;/&quot;) to be unordered mini-lists of just two items:
if a question blanks both terms, the user may enter them in either order.
</p>

<p>
If you do not want this behaviour, then look to rephrase the question:
<pre>
    It matters not if it takes &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; ...
</pre>
is a mini-list.
<pre>
    It does not matter whether it takes a &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;month&lt;/em&gt; ...
</pre>
is not a mini-list but:
</p>

<p>
If, on the other hand, you do want this behaviour, you can always use a proper unordered list:
<pre>
    It does not matter whether it takes
    &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt; or&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a &lt;em&gt;month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
There is a subtle difference between:
<pre>
    I don&apos;t care if it is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; ...
</pre>
and:
<pre>
    I don&apos;t care if it is &lt;em&gt;good/bad&lt;/em&gt; ...
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Both are unordered mini-lists of two terms but the first counts as two choices, the second as only one.
</p>

<p>
Yes, longer mini-lists are possible:
<pre>
    I don&apos;t care if it is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;indifferent&lt;/em&gt; ...
</pre>
but a proper unordered list is probably to be preferred.
</p>



<h3> Html Examples </h3>
<p>
For examples of how the program formats html, look in the test directory.
For example:
<pre>
    ./cribtutor -t -p -s test5
</pre>
prints the lists defined in &quot;test/test5-p.html&quot;.
</p>



<h2> Cribsheet Design </h2>

<p>
There is some flexibility when it comes to crib sheet design.

This is intended to cope with both large and small subjects.

However the approach is far from perfect.
</p>

<p>
One limitation is that there cannot be more than 9 &apos;chapters&apos; or 9 &apos;sections&apos; in a &apos;chapter&apos;
but these are crib sheets, not encyclopedias.
</p>

<p>
Should the limitation of 9 becomes a problem consider restructuring your crib sheets
or even splitting them into two or more subjects.
</p>


<h3> Cribsheets.txt </h3>

<p>
The program requires a file named (by default) &quot;cribsheets.txt&quot;.

This file lists the crib sheets that make up the subject material for a quiz.

Even the simplest subject with only a single crib sheet requires such a file.
</p>

<p>
For larger subjects, the list may get quite long as the set of crib sheets grows and is refactored.

The list should be in quiz order, which is the order in which you would want someone to read the crib sheets.
</p>

<p>
The recommended approach is you create a subdirectory (of the directory in which the program resides)
and place your &quot;cribsheets.txt&quot; file here along with all your crib sheets.  For example:
<pre>
    mkdir c++
    mv templates.html c++
    cat &gt; c++/cribsheets.txt
    templates.html
    ^D
    ./cribtutor -d c++
</pre>
</p>

<p>
You may use &apos;#&apos; to comment your &quot;cribsheets.txt&quot; file
or to comment out files in the list temporarily.

Blank lines are ignored.
</p>


<h3> Chapters and Sections </h3>

<p>
Subject material can be subdivided into to &apos;chapters&apos; and &apos;sections&apos; using html headers.
</p>

<p>
Suppose our subject comprises just one crib sheet file named &quot;templates.html&quot;.

In this case:
<ol>
<li> * &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt; headers introduce</li>
<li> * chapters and sections respectively and</li>
<li> * these are not numbered</li>
</ol>

The user will be presented with the &apos;Skip [yNq] ?&apos; prompt before each chapter/section
and (in general) with the &apos;Repeat [yNq] ?&apos; at the end of each section/chapter.
</p>

<p>
For larger subject material split over several crib sheet files,
the program will move from one crib sheet to the next automatically.

The user can quit at any time and resume with any crib sheet using the &apos;--skipto&apos; flag
and the name of the crib sheet they wish to resume with.
</p>

<p>
It is not expected users will know the names of crib sheets.
It is expected crib sheet files will be &apos;numbered&apos; and users will resume by giving
the chapter/section number at which they wish to resume.
</p>

<p>
Suppose the crib sheet files are numbered thus:
<pre>
    1_Introduction.html
    2_Program-Structure.html
    3_Fundamental-Types.html
    ...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
For single-digit crib sheets files:
<ol>
<li> * the expectation is that each file represents a chapter</li>
<li> * the digit is taken to be the chapter number</li>
<li> * sections are numbered automatically starting with 1</li>
<li> * &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; headers introduce chapters and sections</li>
<li> * &apos;--skipto&apos; can resume with chapters but not sections</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
An even more ambitious approach to crib sheet numbering might have:
<pre>
    3_Fundamental-Types.html
    31_bool.html
    32_char.html
    33_integers.html
    34_floats.html
    ...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
For double-digit crib sheet files:
<ol>
<li> * the expectation is that each file represents a section</li>
<li> * the digits are taken to be the chapter and section number</li>
<li> * &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt; headers introduce chapters and sections</li>
<li> * &apos;--skipto&apos; can resume with sections.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3> The Role of &lt;h1&gt; Headers </h3>

<p>
Are html &lt;h1&gt; headers ignored when &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;h3&gt; headers represent chapter/sections ?

No.
</p>

<p>
For double-digit crib sheet files, an &lt;h1&gt; header is printed out without a prompt.
Except when the header text is the same as the previous &lt;h1&gt; header text.
In which case it is ignored.

Suppose each double-digit crib sheet begins with the same &lt;h1&gt; header.
The program will print the &lt;h1&gt; header text once and once only
whether the user uses &apos;--skipto&apos; or not.
</p>

<p>
For unnumbered crib sheets, &lt;h1&gt; headers are printed in the same circumstances
but are accompanied by a &apos;Skip [yNq] ?&apos; prompt.

An answer of &apos;y&apos; skips the rest of the crib sheet.

There is no &apos;Repeat [yNq] ?&apos; prompt at the end.
</p>



<h2> Breaking Predictability </h2>

<p>
People are good at remembering what comes next in a sequence and will quickly learn their way through a quiz
that always presents the questions in the same way and in the same order.
</p>

<p>
That is not what a crib sheet quiz is about.
It is about being able to recall (almost &apos;at random&apos;) pertinent facts individually and independently of context.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, the program is designed to break the predictability of sequences using pseudo random choices and shuffles.

This, at the very least, forces the user to read and answer each question rather than filling in the blanks by rote.

The higher level of engagement this requires should help the user remember individual facts outside the context of the quiz.
</p>


<h3> Blanking Terms </h3>

<p>
The program blanks terms at random but the crib sheet author determines how many terms there are in each question
and the user chooses how many of these are blanked through the &apos;--choices&apos; command line option.
</p>

<p>
When the number of choices is greater than or equal to the number of terms, all terms are blanked.
Otherwise, the program choose the appropriate number of terms to blank at random.

This means, when a section is repeated, questions with a larger number of terms
will have a different selection blanked thus breaking the predictability.
</p>


<h3> Shuffling Ordered Lists </h3>

<p>
Ordered lists are treated as a single question and so are a common case where the number of terms exceeds the number of choices.

Unlike unordered lists, ordered lists require blanks be filled in question order.

Questions become predictable with practice since they typically provide a lot more context than unordered lists.
</p>

<p>
The author of a crib sheet can introduce an element of unpredictability
by adding a specific comment to the html source of an ordered list:

<pre>
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;!-- Shuffle List --&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
            ...
        &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
</pre>

The comment instructs the program to shuffle the list items before generating a question.
</p>

<p>
Since the user will be presented with list items in a different order to which they were written,
extra care needs to be taken to ensure each item makes sense on its own.
</p>

<p>
At present the user cannot turn such shuffling on and off.

There is no means of shuffling items in unordered lists.
</p>


<h3> Shuffling Paragraphs </h3>

<p>
The third way in which the program can break the predictability of a quiz is to randomise the order of questions by shuffling html paragraphs.
</p>

<p>
The author of a crib sheet introduces this element of unpredictability by adding a pair of specific html comments either side of the
html paragraphs to be shuffled:

<pre>
    &lt;!-- Shuffle On --&gt;

    ...

    &lt;!-- Shuffle Off --&gt;
</pre>

The program takes the &quot;Shuffle On&quot; comment as an instruction to shuffle the paragraphs that follow until it encounters a &quot;Shuffle Off&quot; comment,
and html header or the end of file.

Several groups of paragraphs within the same section may be each shuffled individually.
</p>

<p>
Since the user will be presented with questions in a different order to which the paragraphs were written,
extra care needs to be taken to ensure each paragraph makes sense on it own.
</p>

<p>
At present the user cannot turn such shuffling on and off.
</p>



<h2> Development Tips </h2>

<p>
You may use any text or html editor to prepare your crib sheets.

WYSIWYG editors have a reputation for generating all sorts of nonsense that you get but cannot see.
The program should simply ignore such nonsense but experiment a little to make sure before writing your first serious crib sheet.
</p>

<p>
The structure of html is such that one missing / or a / where is it should not be produces nonsense.

How html browsers and viewers cope with syntax errors is not mandated.

Some cope better than others.
</p>
<p>
The cribtutor program is &apos;simple&apos; and does not try to second guess what was intended
but it does implement a couple of features to help spot and correct syntax errors.
</p>

<p>
Consider the command line:
<pre>
    ./cribtutor -d c++ -s temp
</pre>
which may well run a quiz starting with the crib sheet file &apos;c++/templates.html&apos;.
The command line:
<pre>
    ./cribtutor -d c++ -s temp -p
</pre>
will parse the file &apos;c++/templates.html&apos;, print the parse tree and exit.
</p>

<p>
This is a useful sanity check:  a quick visual inspection to confirm it all looks good before trying a quiz.
</p>

<p>
If nothing is output, the parser has crashed.

This is almost certainly due to some corner case resulting in string::npos being passed as a parameter to some std:string class method where it should not be.
The code has been thrice reviewed to avoid such crashes so they are unlikely but not impossible.
</p>

<p>
The program has been carefully coded to cope with unexpected end-of-file:  all open html elements are closed.

The result will probably be a very long line of jumbled text that may suggest where the syntax error is but not what it is.
</p>

<p>
As an aid to debugging, the program will print out an unexpected close tag.

It will also print out an unexpected nested open tag (such as a paragraph within a paragraph).

Look for one of these just before any jumbling to see what the problem is.
</p>

<p>
A final tip.

If you run a quiz and get a long sequence of &quot;____&quot; where you were not expecting one,
there are probably two terms, the first of which is missing its close tag.

Perhaps &lt;/me&gt; instead of &lt;/em&gt;.
</p>



<h2> Design Tips </h2>

<p>
Writing any language is more difficult than reading or speaking it.

You cannot know if the reader understands what you mean and you cannot rephrase when they don't.
All you can do is your best to make your meaning clear.
</p>

<p>
Now deliberately remove several (key) words from each sentence and you have a fill-in-the-blanks quiz.
</p>

<p>
What follow are a number of tips you might find useful
but it is recommended you experiment and find your own style.
The examples are, of course, a little on the trivial side.
</p>


<h3> Broad Brush Strokes </h3>

<p>
You are likely to base your crib sheet on existing documentation.

You could start with a copy/paste (so long as that doesn&apos;t violate copyright)
but it is recommended you don&apos;t.
</p>

<p>
Make your own notes of the things you think are important to remember and start from those.

As you make/enter these notes consider the structure of your crib sheet in terms of chapter/sections
and rearrange your notes as you go along.
</p>

<p>
Your notes may include examples and even lists but, if you are using a text editor, go light on the html markup.

Your notes may have &lt; and &gt; in them and it is probably best to convert these to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; before adding too much html markup.
</p>

<p>
These characters may occur most often in examples, so refining these may be something you will want to do earlier rather than later.

Enclose examples in &lt;pre&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;.
</p>

<p>
You should convert &amp; &apos; and &quot; to their html equivalents but you can do this any time.

Since this tends to make the original text less easy to read, the later you convert these the better.
</p>

<p>
Next consider your sentences.

Short declarative sentences are best.

Consider breaking long sentences into several short ones.

You might make notes with a blank line between each sentence:  you can always group several together into one paragraph later.
</p>

<p>
Next you might tidy up and enter html markup for lists, both ordered and unordered.
</p>

<p>
Now you might go through the plain text of your crib sheet and mark the terms in each sentence and each list item.

Do this without thinking about how many blanks per question.
</p>

<p>
At this point you need to check for mini-lists you created when marking up terms.

It is actually quite easy to create these without realising.

Consider whether you want / don&apos;t want each one and revise accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Next add paragraph markup.

Paragraphs can have more that one sentence.

As you proceed, consider how many terms there are in paragraph.

You may want to revise both to achieve a more even distribution.
</p>

<p>
You might even consider splitting really long lists into shorter, easier to remember lists.
</p>

<p>
If you&apos;ve not used a spell checker yet, do so.

Now you are ready to run your crib sheet past the program.
</p>

<p>
First use the -p option to just print the parsed crib sheet without questions.

Read it through.  Revise, particularly any apparent html syntax errors.  Repeat.
</p>

<p>
Only now try a quiz generated from your crib sheet.  Revise, particularly with respect to consistency.  Repeat.
</p>

<p>
Leave it a day and try your crib sheet quiz again with a larger number of choices.

Leave it a week and try again with an even larger number of choices.
</p>

<p>
If you are lucky enough to have a guinea pig, let it loose on your crib sheet quiz and take feed back seriously.

Especially when it squeals.
</p>


<h3> Avoid Ambiguity:  Be Consistent </h3>

<p>
The word markup could be written mark-up or even mark up.
You have no problem reading that.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a crib sheet that uses all three spellings and then imagine the word is blanked out.
You know the answer but you&apos;d have to guess which spelling has been blanked out.
</p>

<p>
Image that a few questions later, it is blanked out again.
You&apos;d probably guess the same as last time and you might not be lucky.
</p>

<p>
This kind of ambiguity is very annoying and counter-productive.
Being consistent is essential.
</p>

<p>
In this case, pick one spelling and stick to it.
Which spelling you choose is far less important.
</p>

<p>
As another example, consider a &apos;sort order&apos; and sequence that has this sort order.
Is the sequence sorted or ordered ?
It is both, of course, but for the purposes of a crib sheet you need to pick one and stick to it.
</p>


<h3> The Gentle Art of Reinforcement </h3>

<p>
Do you find the verses of a song or the chorus easier to remember ?
</p>

<p>
Forget whatever they told you in school about writing interesting prose.

Repetition is good in crib sheets and not just for the sake of consistency.
</p>

<p>
Keep sentences short, keep them declarative.

Fortunately the nature of a crib sheet should encourage this.
</p>

<p>
A quiz is not supposed to be all that hard.

It is about making it easier to recall what is already known.

It is about reinforcing what the person doing the quiz has previously learnt.
</p>

<p>
Repetition is good, not just consistent spelling and use of terms
but in the structure of sentences and sections.
</p>

<p>
Consider a crib sheet that concerns IP addresses.

It is natural to refer to the &quot;address&quot; because it is clear from the context that this means &quot;IP address&quot;.
</p>

<p>
However, writing IP address (at least for the first occurrence in a paragraph)
helps reinforce the notion that the crib sheet is about IP, and not some other kind of, addresses.

It may also provide just that little extra context needed to fill in the blanks.
</p>

<p>
Here is another very trivial example:
<pre>
   Use ____() to close the file.
</pre>
You might think that a bit of a give away and prefer something like:
<pre>
   Use ____() to sever the connection to the file.
</pre>
It makes for a harder quiz but does not help reinforce the message that to close a file, use the eponymous function.
</p>


<h3> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog </h3>

<p>
Choosing which words to turn into terms that may be blanked in a quiz is not always straight forward.

Deciding which words you would highlight with a marker pen is usually a good start.
</p>

<p>
You will of course, want to experiment, but it would seem that blanking nouns (fox, dog)
works better than verbs (leaps) or adjectives (sly, red, sleepy).
Adverbs seems to be particularly hard to remember.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the word you would want to highlight is an adjective:
<pre>
    To stop, press the ____ button
</pre>
but highlighting the noun will work just as well:
<pre>
    To stop, press the red ____
</pre>
because what the user needs to remember &apos;red button&apos;.
</p>


<h3> Visual Clues </h3>

<p>
Consider the question:
<pre>
    Use the ____ function to associate an IP address and port with a ____.
</pre>
This question is not all that hard but change it to:
<pre>
    Use ____ to associate an address/port with a ____.
</pre>
The question appears to want two nouns but the first noun names the verb &apos;bind&apos;.
This can be confusing.
</p>

<p>
One way of avoiding the confusion is to provide a visual clue to indicate the answer is the name of a function:
<pre>
    Use ____() to associate an address/port with a ____.
</pre>
The answer is &apos;bind&apos; (without parentheses).
</p>

<p>
Use the parentheses as a visual clue.
Questions phrased so the answer is &apos;bind()&apos; (with parentheses) will annoy users and teach them nothing.
</p>


<h3> How Many Blanks ? </h3>

<p>
The more blanks there are in a question the more difficult it is to answer the question
(without a typo).
</p>

<p>
Since the default is to blank at most two terms per question, questions with only one or two terms
have all terms blanked.

Aiming for three or four terms per question seems like a good opening gambit
as random blanking of terms will make the quiz more interesting.
</p>

<p>
For unordered lists, there will most likely be one term per list item.
For ordered lists, there may well be two terms per list item.
More than just two terms need to be blanked.
</p>

<p>
This is why the &apos;--choices&apos; flag is there and why the program will automatically increment the choices
when the user gets a section right and chooses to repeat.
</p>

<p>
As the number of choices increases, the program stops turning paragraphs with few terms into questions
so that the user may concentrate on the lists.
</p>
