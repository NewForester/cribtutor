<h1> For notes on how to write crib sheets using Markdown syntax return </h1>

<p>
Html describes how to render a web-page.  It is not a very convenient format for writing web-page contents.
Wikis provide mark-up languages geared toward writing content and translate the mark-up into html for rendering.
</p>
<p>
One such language is Markdown.
This is used, for example, on GitHub.
There are several translators that will convert text with Markdown mark-up into html.
</p>
<p>
Writing crib sheets using a wiki mark-up and using a translator can avoid a lot of tedious editing time.
With Markdown there a couple of small snags.
</p>


<h2> Lists and Code Blocks within Paragraphs </h2>

<p>
Cribtutor considers a list to be part of a question.
This means the program expects each html list element to be a sub element of a paragraph element.
The same is true of pre-formatted text such as code blocks.
</p>
<p>
This is not what Markdown translators generate.
List elements and pre-formatted text are block elements equal to paragraphs.
This is, in part, because Markdown supports list items that comprise one or more paragraphs etc.
</p>
<p>
The cribtutor program compensates but sometimes you may not want this.
To illustrate, consider:
<pre>
    The cardinal points are:

      * _north_,
      * _south_,
      * _east_ and
      * _west_

    but home is best.
</pre>
The blank lines either side of the list are required otherwise Markdown and translators do not recognise the list as a list.
The translators generate a list that is not within a paragraph, so cribtutor, without compensation, would simply ignore the list.
</p>
<p>
The program compensates by:
<ol>
<li>- inserting a new paragraph and making the list a sub-element;</li>
<li>- if the element following the list is a paragraph, merging the two paragraphs;</li>
<li>- if the element preceding the list is a paragraph, merging the two paragraphs.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The effect is to treat the example above as one paragraph and thus one quiz question.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you do not want the following/preceding paragraph to be merged, begin/end it with a comment.
<pre>
    &lt;!-- --&gt;
</pre>
will do nicely.
</p>
<p>
For example, the following will be considered three separate paragraphs:
<pre>
    The cardinal points are.
    &lt;!-- --&gt;

      * _north_,
      * _south_,
      * _east_ and
      * _west_

    &lt;!-- --&gt;
    But home is best.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The compensation and use of comments to prevent it applies to unordered (bullet) lists, ordered (numbered) lists and pre-formatted text (code blocks).
</p>


<h2> Shuffling Lists </h2>

<p>
To use the list shuffling feature (already described) with Markdown, you should write an ordered list as:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
    1. &lt;!-- Shuffle List --&gt;
       First list item.
    2. Second list item.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This places the comment at the beginning of the first item of the list instead of at the beginning of the list.
Cribtutor knows this and compensates.
</p>


<h2> Code Spans </h2>

<p>
Markdown syntax also supports code spans, which do occur within paragraphs:
<pre>
    This is a `code span` within a sentence.
</pre>
translates to the html:
<pre>
    This is a &lt;code&gt;code span&lt;/code&gt; within a sentence.
</pre>
Cribtutor honours the original Markdown syntax and will render this as:
<pre>
    This is a `code span` within a sentence.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Blankable terms may be enclosed in code spans thus:
<pre>
    This is a `*blankable compound term*` within a code span.
</pre>
Some Markdown translators may ignore Markdown syntax within code spans.
As far as blankable terms are concerned, cribtutor compensates.
</p>


<h2> Other Considerations </h2>

<p>
Markdown syntax supports block quotes, for which translators generate &lt;blockquote&gt; elements.
Cribtutor simply ignores these.
</p>

<p>
GitHub Markdown accepts some WikiMedia syntax links.
Markdown translators may ignore these as does cribtutor.
