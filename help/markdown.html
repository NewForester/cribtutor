<h1> For notes on how to write crib-sheets using Markdown syntax press return </h1>

<p>
HTML describes how to render a web-page.  It is not a very convenient format for writing web-page contents.
Wikis provide mark-up languages geared toward writing content and translate the mark-up into HTML for rendering.
</p>
<p>
One such language is Markdown, used, for example, on GitHub.
There are several translators that will convert text with Markdown mark-up into HTML.
One such translator is `pandoc`:
<pre>
    pandoc example.md > example.html
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Writing crib-sheets using a wiki mark-up and using a translator can avoid a lot of tedious editing time:
<ol>
<li>- seldom any need to add HTML tags by hand;</li>
<li>- seldom any need to escape characters in code samples;</li>
<li>- source remains readable and convenient to change.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Terms that may be blanked by cribtutor should be marked with &apos;_&apos; or &apos;*&apos;.
Using &apos;*&apos; in preference to &apos;_&apos; may confuse your spell checker less often.
</p>

<p>
Markdown requires a blank line between paragraphs.
As a consequence, a blank line needs to appear either side of code blocks, lists and
also (should you need to use them) HTML block elements.
A blank line is needed:  an HTML comment will not suffice nor will back ticks.
<pre>
    Here is an example:

    ```html
        &lt;p&gt;A tad tedious but less so that raw HTML&lt;/p&gt;
    ```

    Note how a blank line is required either side of a code block.
</pre>
</p>


<h2> Lists and Code Blocks within Paragraphs </h2>

<p>
Cribtutor considers a list to be part of a question.
This means the program expects each HTML list element to be a sub element of a paragraph element.
The same is true of pre-formatted text such as code blocks.
</p>
<p>
This is not what Markdown translators generate:
list elements and pre-formatted text are block elements equal to paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
The cribtutor program compensates but sometimes you may not want this.
To illustrate, consider:
<pre>
    The cardinal points are:

      + *north*,
      + *south*,
      + *east* and
      + *west*

    but home is best.
</pre>
The blank lines either side of the list are required otherwise Markdown and translators do not recognise the list as a list.
The translators generate a list that is not within a paragraph, which, without compensation, cribtutor would simply ignore.
</p>
<p>
The program compensates by (internally):
<ol>
<li>- inserting a new paragraph and making the list a sub-element;</li>
<li>- if the element following the list is a paragraph, merging the two paragraphs;</li>
<li>- if the element preceding the list is a paragraph, merging the two paragraphs.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The effect is to treat the example above as one paragraph and thus one quiz question.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you do not want the following/preceding paragraph to be merged, begin/end it with a comment:
<pre>
    &lt;!-- --&gt;
</pre>
will do nicely.
</p>
<p>
For example, the following will be considered three separate paragraphs:
<pre>
    There are *four* cardinal points.
    &lt;!-- --&gt;

      + *north*,
      + *south*,
      + *east* and
      + *west*

    &lt;!-- --&gt;
    But, whatever or which ever, home is *best*.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The compensation, and the use of comments to prevent it, applies to unordered (bullet) lists, ordered (numbered) lists and pre-formatted text (code blocks).
</p>



<h2> Shuffling Lists </h2>

<p>
To use the list shuffling feature with Markdown, you should write an ordered list as:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
    1. &lt;!-- Shuffle List --&gt;
       First list item.
    2. Second list item.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This places the comment at the beginning of the first item of the list instead of at the beginning of the list.
Cribtutor knows this and compensates.
</p>


<h2> Code Spans </h2>

<p>
Markdown syntax also supports code spans, which occur within paragraphs:
<pre>
    This is a `code span` within a sentence.
</pre>
translates to the HTML:
<pre>
    This is a &lt;code&gt;code span&lt;/code&gt; within a sentence.
</pre>
Cribtutor honours the original Markdown syntax and will render this as:
<pre>
    This is a `code span` within a sentence.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
One of the advantages of code spans, as with code blocks, is that you do not need to escape characters
that otherwise would be interpreted by HTML (such as &apos;&lt;&apos; and &apos;&amp;&apos;).
However, it is not clear whether you can include Markdown syntax in code spans.
The original Markdown specification does not say you cannot but GitHub and `pandoc` appear to ignore it.
Regardless, cribtutor will recognise blankable terms within code spans.
<pre>
    This is a `*blankable compound term*` within a code span.
</pre>
</p>


<h2> Other Considerations </h2>

<p>
Markdown syntax supports block quotes, for which translators generate &lt;blockquote&gt; elements.
Cribtutor simply ignores these.
</p>

<p>
GitHub Markdown accepts some WikiMedia syntax for hyper-links.
Markdown translators may ignore these as does cribtutor.
